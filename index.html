        <h1>My COMP4461 Timelines</h1>

        <p>Created: 7-2-2022</p>

        <h2>First update on the group project!</h2>

        <p>Created: 26-2-2022</p>

        <p>We have decided to make an app design with the idea of 'Smart Laudry'. 
          The reason behind this is that, we found ourselves all have the idea to improve the laudry rooms on campus. 
          The thing is, everytime a student goes down to laudry rooms, he found no machines available, and have to either wait or go back to his room with no luck.
          Another thing is, many students they just forgot to take their clothes out even the washing is finished anyway.
          Think of a persona, we got a busy student, he has many deadlines coming, there's not really much time left, how can he even bother with washing clothes?? There should be a better solution to this!.
          So what's our app? We decide to show the realtime status of the machines 
          I joined the task on making the apps on a website called 'figma'. </p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl> -->

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre> -->

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |

     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote> -->
