        <h2>Group project 3 - Social VR Cultural World</h2>
        <p>Created: 4-5-2022</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>Upon reading the project instruction PDF, Me and our groupmates have a very vague idea on actually what we are
          going to implement. Because the scope is very large for VR applications. After reading and watching some
          user scenario like mozilla hub and VRChat. I get some idea on what the project prototype may look like.
        </p>
        <p>Our initial idea were really normal. Like some sports game, simple games inside it. Karaoke, watching films,
          concerting together, some other things also includes window shopping in a VR world. However, these idea don't
          have any charateristics inside it, it is also quite boring, that is, there not a theme.
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, if we want to make things more complicated, let's say making a hide and seek game, or Among us style
          game inside our VR world. However, the functions provided by mozilla hub is really limited. I later found that 
          mozilla hub isn't for game at all, people were saying it as a alternative to zoom, or zoom class.
          While another VR software VRChat is more game orientated. But we all thought that way the project will be
          too complicated, we are time limited and therefore don't have the time to continue on that
        </p>
        <p>Then someone mention that, how about we make a language learning theme. It as like people will be gathering 
          inside the VR world, and they will chat with each other using different languages. It will be a perfect scenario
          where language-learners can get themseleves into the atmosphere. Later we also decide to boarden the 
          the scope a bit. Make it tourist/museum like theme. And because of this is a international theme, we just want 
          to put international famous heritage around the world, and in the centre it will be a flat piazza for people
          to gather and chat. It also acts as a centre point for us. It will be a outdoor theme, since I think these years
          people can't go out to travel because of COVID, and making ourdoor theme will be better.
        </p>
        <h3>Start - Find base map</h3>
        <p>then we decided to find base map and start building it in the spoke.
          I had to say spoke interface are kind of user friendly. But later it will become a disater because of this.
          As we don't want to stuck with old maps, so we need to find a new map, and it has to be beautiful.

        </p>
        <img src="images/p31.jpg" width="1000" height="300">
        <img src="images/p32.jpg" width="1000" height="300">
        <p>We found some really good map on Sketchfab. They are really good looking and nice. Some of them
          are scanned or hand-built, but at the end they are really high definition. Some maps are not in .glb format
          originally, so it can't be loaded into spoke directly. But download it first and then convert it into .glb in blender
          solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>But when we try to export maps into mozilla hubs to test its size and texture, spoke isn't happy about it.
          Until now, I get to know that, spoke generates collision and walkable planes using two different techniques.
          Normally the walking plane is generated using trimesh. Trimesh provides a high definition walking plane, And
          user can walk up slope, uneven terrain. So every plane are made of triangles. However, although this method works fine
          in small indoor map. For such a big complex outdoor terrain map, it is too complicated for spoke to generate such terrain.
          and often it will throw out error such as 'error generating nav mesh'. And we always find it hard to upload onto
          mozilla hub.<br>
          <img src="images/p33.jpg" width="400" height="400"><br>
          You can see the 'force trimesh' box in this picture. Normally spoke will be using trimesh and 2d plane
        at the same time. Force trimesh is well, as stated.</p>

          <p>The second method is called 2d plane. So it can only create planes that are different height. mostly 
            slopes are ignored. So the user can't walk on terrain. And it is very confusing to have somewhere you can't walk.
          It't like meeting a airwall in a game.
          c
          You can see the floor plan meseed up on slopes, and for stonhenge it's another mess. It means that the user can'walk inside the
          stonhenge, and walk up the slope.
          </p>
        <p>So at the end, we settled on the default terrain map, we added a flat plane on it, so it would 
          be flat. And we can place objects on it without making to much of adjustment to the objects.
          <img src="images/p35.jpg" width="1000" height="300">
          This is the end product that ends up in the demo video.
          The grey flat plane is what I mentioned. And we added objects to the plane. Moreover, clouds like sphere were also
          added. Also the 'simple' water object was placed to make the titanic looks like sinking into the water.
          <img src="images/p36.jpg" width="1000" height="300">
          You may already figured out. We want to make a scene in the Titanic film. And it would be fun to 
          get a feeling of standing at the end of the ship, to feel what that height feels.
          <h3>Models - Processing</h3>
          <h>We took some models on Sketchfab to be our heritage objects. But there are some models that 
            are either hand-made or scanned using photogrammerty. We had a Fumishimi Castle in our map, which that model
            was originally scanned into a 3D object.
          </h>
          <img src="images/p37.jpg" width="1000" height="400">
          The original model is even larger than this, it is as if it's the whole scenery in there.
          But we need to trim it down as a smaller object. The reason is, a small history lesson first. The japanese
          castle were designed so high, and have a base that are multi stories is that, they can be higher when someone
          trys to attack the castle. But it means that the floor plan generation and collision handling will be 
          very hard for us. So we need to trim down the model in blender first, make it 'simpler'.
        </p>
          <h3>Battling with the max size limit - 128MB</h3>
          <p>Somewhere into our peoject, after we placed some of the objects into the the world. And we found 
            that it cannot be compiled. The reason simply is, mozilla hub only supports a world up to 128MB!!!!!
            That means we need to shrink some sizes of the objects!! For example, a stonehenge will take approx. 37MB.
            a fushimi castle took up 32MB. There's really not much of the space left.
          </p>
          <p>So what we done, is to reduce the texture size. The original texture in Fushimi Castle in 8K, which is 
            8192*8192. We reduces its size to 2048*2048 in photoshop. And that castle only takes up 15MB now!
          <img src="images/p38.jpg" width="1000" height="400">
          We also changes the stonehenge to a simple one.
          Instead of the very high definition stonehenge you saw in m=my previous shot. The new stonhenge is
          rather simple, low poly. And it doesn't even have textures. So we need to paint it in brown in blender.
          The new stonehenge now only eats up 1MB of size!
        </p>
        <p>Our final product eats up 127MB of size. This is really the most extreme size we can take. one more simple
          object would exceeds the size limit and ruin the whole thing!
        </p>
        <p>Small reflection->I can imagine in the future I will be working with limited resources..I guess it's better
          to save resources for later use at first, so when later optimizing the size, it would be alot easier to shrink 
          its sizes.
        </p>
        <h3>Games implementation</h3>
        <p>As I said, we want to implement games inside the mozilla hub. But it is function limited.
          I tried make a basketball field inside it, but playing with it was rather boring. Primarily because of the
          hitbox are wrong, and controlling, moving things inside the hub is very hard.
          <img src="images/p39.jpg" width="1000" height="400">
          So a guy suggest that, why we make some local traditional games around the world. That sounds interesting, And
          relatively easy to implement, also fits our culture exchange theme.
          <img src="images/p310.jpg" width="1000" height="400">
          I searched some local games on web. And these traditional games are all mainly boardgames, so it's really easy
          to implement. and we use duck+chicken to be our chess. The fron two games are Kaooa from India and another strategy
          game from South Korea. The 3 games behind that are 3 different three in a row games from 3 different countries.
          Though If I have time I would change the texture of the chicken. because that chicken is in white color, while 
          game map is also in white, it will be maybe a little bit hard to distinguish.
        </p>
        <h3>DemoVideo</h3>
        <p>I get to create Demo video for the project. I get the idea from a discontinued programme by TVB. It's called
          the Earth Live (瞬間看地球), and it has been discontinued in the April the 1st. It's really sad lo...
          <img src="images/p311.jpg" width="421" height="237">
          <br>The programme is just a live camera around the world. But I think that is a small part of collective memories of 
          Hong Kong. So I want to mimic the programme, by using the same UIs and Musics from it.
          <img src="images/p312.jpg" width="1000" height="400">
          You can see I photoshoped the UI into the video.
          And that UI acted as a title also for each part of the demo.
          In the demo I introduced and demo-ed many concepts in thie world, such as timetable feture, it's like, I don't know
          someone who's reading this have played GTAv before, on the online server, there will be random event every 5-10 minutes or so.
          And player will be motivated to paticipate in such event, so the online game play will be more interesting.
          It is the same idea in our world, but a little different. Just the events are talks/shars/tours/games, they are
          more 'educational' I would say. Because if you get into the world without anything todo, it would be rather boring.
          It also have souvenir exchange feature, which I see it as a good way to enhance exchange among players.
        </p>
        <h3>End Credits</h3>
        <p>Till the end of this project. To be honest, I personally think the whole map can be better, as well as the 
          lighting. I asked a friend which I do needfinding and surverying about the final product, he's also the guy
          who gives me initial idea on making a tourists spot map first. He said the map looks like a 3D game from the 
          early 2000s. Where I can't agreed anymore. Because I later realized the lighting in mozilla hub is really
          for indoor lighting. I can imagine other group using directional lighting to make a colorful pub out of this.
        </p>
        <p>More so, I with the size limit in the mozilla hub can be larger, Like at least 256MB of 200MB. Then 
          we can put more building in the map to fill blanks, so the whole world will be prettier. and the objects will
          be more high definition, and you can really walk under the stonehenge to feel what is like under the great rocks.
          
        </p>
        <p>But anyway, I think the idea is what our project really shines. Because when we are thinking this project,
          the normal ideas, like concert, karaoke and video watching is really old-school, and there are many alternatives
          now, like Discord. Think if you are a user, why would I use this instead of discord?
          Same goes for the games idea, why won't I just play human fall flat? Why I don't just play animal crossing or 
          other sports games? 
          When you start thinking this, you will realize there are really too much good product now, and it is really
          meaningless to make a bad replication of those.
        </p>
        <p>But, there's no such culture/language exchange world right now, yes? Since people can't go our to travel due to
          travel restriction of COVID, people don't have the chance to talk to others right? Then why won't us make people 
          meet in the virtual world?
          Oh yeah! Not to mention We have a souvenir feature, which allows players to exchange souvenirs that are a icon of
          its country with others! That's really the point, the highlight of our project, and that's what differs ours to other
          normal VR world. It will be a world with interactive, fruitful events.

        <h2>Group project 2 - Self Quarantine Chatbot</h2>
        <p>Created: 30-3-2022</p>
        
        <h3>Where did the idea came from?</h3>
        <p>When I first about that, the project is about a quarantine robot, I don't know what is really about
          maybe only some vague ideas, but not know exactly how the robot should do.
        </p>
        <p>So I decided to ask my friends about it. I have some friends study aboared. And when they come back to
          Hong Kong, they will have to be quarantine for 14 days. They said the quarantine process is very boring. There's
          not much they can do in the quarantine room. Moreover, they said because they can't do exercises in the room,
          so they will get fatter later on.
        </p>
        <p>And, Luckily, one of our groupmate elizabeth is a exchange student, she also shared about her own experiences
          in the quarantine, which mostly matched the feedback from above. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ideas are evolving</h3>
        <p>We firstly created the mindmap about the robot functions in Google slides, which is a rather simple version
          and later on we decided we would move them to mindmeister(same as lastime)
        </p>
        
        <img src="images/p2mindmap.jpg" width="1000" height="300">
        <p>To explain this in a simple way. I think the robot should have some entertainment features to keep
          user happy during the whole quarantine process. It would suggest some musics, workout youtube videos.
          Moreover, it should tell users some jokes to cheer the user up, and it would give some random images to
          make the user's quarantine life more elements. At last, I wish to implement a mini-wordle. (But that didn't work).
        </p>
        <p>It should also have informational features. We are also targetting it as a personal assistant.
          So it can return time information, weather information.
        </p>
        <p>At last, it is a quarantine robot. So it should have some functions related to covid19, right?
          We think, it should provide latest covid informations, as well as 'what user should do' if the user is confirmed
          positive, or felt unwell. At last, as in quarantine, it is eazy so lose the sense of dates, time. So There a 
          quarantine progress, the user can inquire the quarantine progress.
        </p>

        <h3>Storyboarding - what might happened</h3>
        <p>This is the least thing I want to declare as my work, but, fine, I drew this *masterpiece*</p>
        <p>I want to express that, the user got into quarantine hotel, but he felt very bored, watched all
           youtube videos, and when he feels unwell, no one could help him. But then he found the quarantine
         chatbot, then suddenly his problem were solved. and his felt very good. Lastly at the end of the quarantine
         He felt love with the robot, and he don't want to leave anymore.</p>

        <img src="images/Storyboard4.jpg" width="500" height="500">

        <h3>Coding - The real part</h3>
        <p>We have 3 people working on the code works. 
          I was incharge of implementing some entertainment functions. Also, I try to make the robot as humanly as possible.</p>
        <h4>Part 1 - Python Action.py - getting images/texts from online APIs</h4>
        <p>For the robot to return more interesting content to us, it would have to run things in python, which is done
          by implementing custom actions inside action.py. For example, In order to return images from the website,
          it would have to GET images from the APIs. I have not work with an APIs in Python before(not in any languages...)
          But with the help from teammates, I can pull the image and texts from the web. The format pulled are a python dictionary,
          so I can do `something = data['attribute']` to pull the things I want. Here is a implementation of the program 
          custom action to pull cat images from some random images API.
          <img src="images/Python0.png" width="650" height="280">
          <p>In this class, def name is for rasa to recognise this class, it return the custom action name. So the rasa knows
            if the bot were to run 'action_cat_img', it would run this class. And def run function is the actual implementation
            of the custom actions. I think the first function is like a identifier, the second one is like the actual body. 
            The implementation is the same for returning dog images.

            <p>Below is more complicated example. But it is similar, What I am trying to do is to pull travel images.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Python1.png" width="800" height="240">
            <p>Similarly, Pulling text jokes</p>
            <img src="images/Python2.png" width="500" height="240">
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h4>Part 2 - Python Action.py - Dealing with time/ storing/ printing</h4>
        <p>In this part, I try to make the bot greet to the time of the day, say good morning good afternoon and good evening. also
          return a time , date in a organised, user friendly format ⬇️.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Python3.png" width="800" height="440">
        <p>In here, I am trying to implement the start quarantine action. Because we need to keep track of the quarantine progress,
          we need to store the date that the user start quarantine. Rasa comes with entity function to store text or number information.
          But I thought doing this in python will be faster and more convenient. Which turns out to be true.
          I store the current date and time the user start quarantine to the dictionary. Then it is stored to the json files locally. By doing so,
          when rasa restarts, the dates would not lost ⬇️.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Python4.png" width="800" height="300">
        <p>Then next, I implemented the can i leave function. Which is to tell the user then he can leave. In this function, I can then load back the json
          files I just stored. In here, I decided to print out a progress bar. This is to show the quarantine progress. I think it's good to have a progress bar,
          such that users knows their progress graphically, and maybe this progress bar act like a complishment, supporting them finish the quarantine ⬇️.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Python5.png" width="800" height="370">
        <p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
        <h4>Part 3 - Rasa parts - intents/ action/ rules</h4>
        <P>In this part, I will work the modules within Rasa. I don't want to explain too deeply how it works. (This diary is getting way too long...)
          In the nlu.yml files there's nothing special, I will mainly talk about the domain and stories files.
        </P>
        <p>Below is showing a part of the stories.yml . In this file, I defined serveral path on my functions. Such as, when a user ask for music, it
          will ask the user which type of music the user want, then return corresponding musics to the user, match that type. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/Rasa0.png" width="920" height="920">
        <p>⬇️Below is showing the domain.yml file. This is where I defined the actions, though default. In here, my goal is to make as much as reactions
          possible. By putting multiple text responses under the same action, rasa would choose randomly which text responses to take. So in this case, the 
          responses are more random, the robot talks like a human
        </p>
        <img src="images/Rasa1.png" width="820" height="600">
        <p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
        <h3>Coding&Thoughts - How do I make it respond like a human...</h3>
        <p>This is a long story.... If you had pay attention to what I showed above, mainly the codes, you will find there's many 'decoration'
          What I am trying to do in those case is to make the robot respond as humanly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>This is a good example. Both responses are a online responeses pulled from an API. In the previous testing, we found that,
          sometimes network may lag. This is especially true when we host the robot on other server. In this case, I wish it to provide something first,
          so the user won't have to wait for a blank screen. Moreover, let's say if the user want weather, I add the robot actions before my teammates 
          work, so it will feel more of human-like. I also want to see things the prespective of the robot. So by using 'asking my friend at HKO' ,
          it would make much of the sense, the rasa robot is asking the friends in HKO, which is happended to be a robot that boardcast APIs. So 
          the information makes sense, also the users get to know where the weather information comes from. Same for the jokes, it would need something before
          the actual jokes returned. Moreover, this is a robot, so why not programmer jokes?
        </p>
        <img src="images/Rasa2.png" width="700" height="100">
        <P>The second example, is where I used a lot of emojis and emoticon (表情符號 or 顔文字 if you like).
          I thought, well, human use emojis as well, so why don't my chatbot use it. Luckily rasa can direcly support print out of these complicated emojis.
          And I thought it is better. From my prespective, this would assembly what my girl friend (if I have had one🥲) will say to me, with many emojis.
        </P>
        <img src="images/Rasa3.png" width="500" height="400">
        <p>Remember I mentioned a progress bar and the Greet to the time of the day in the actions.py files?
          By using the greet to the time of the day, the robot will say good/morning/evening/afternoon to you according to the time, 
          make it like a human.</p>
        <p>Below is the progress bar. I think it would be better than just showing only a day left, of percentage left. It is good to 
          show this as a bar. Like a game loading bar. Also, I have added emojis and indications, to add oil to users.
        </p>

        <p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
        <h3>Unfinished mini-wordle game...</h3>
        <p>I want to make a wordle games inside rasa. So users could play with rasa when boring. But due to my knowledge limitation, I can't.
          I made the forms, the entity to store the user guessed words, I also made the 2 actions, one to randomly choose a word from the word list,
          another one to validate uers word. Everything sounds fine, but I can't make past the nlu.yml.
        </p>
        <p>In RASA, users intents is triggered by matching words in the nlu.yml. The problem is, I can't make sure everytime users input a wordle guess,
          the robot will know he is playing wordle, and repeatedly executing that intent. If the users answer something that is not in the wordlist,
          The intent won't be triggerd... and validate function won't be called... then everything won't work</p>
          <img src="images/Rasa5.png" width="500" height="300">
        <h4>I am exhausted in typing and chur-ing. Can I end this now?</h4>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
        <h3>Ending - Reflection</h3>
        <p>At last, I am pretty confident and satisfied on the humanly reactions, speech tone of the final product.
          I would take this experience next time if I have to design simiar project, that is, think robot as a human.
          what a human would do, I would emulate, implement then in the robot. It is as imagining the robot is a real
          man.
        </p>
        <p>But, I still think If I have more time, I should finalize, tweak more on the nlu intent part. The first problem is we discovered
          some problems in the final testing of the prototype. That is, we found sometimes our intent is not properly captured.
          I found that we three coder are too focused on the functions, responses part, but we kind of ignored the
          intent part. So the robot talks like a human, but it didn't 'think' or 'interpret' things as a human, specifically,
          not that well trained, our nlu model.
        </p>
        <p>The second problem is somehow linked to the first one. I said we didn't match users words perfectly with user intents.
          Then now, the problem is we didn't design many 'intents' to express our own thinking. Let's say you saw a cute cat image,
          a normal would respond it with 'Wow, that's cute!' . But I didn't think of this and design this intent, so sometimes
          for daily talks (excepting requests) , the robot can't respond properly as we didn't implement many ways for users
          to express his intent. But hey, Siri and Google assistant won't work as intented sometimes lah. So I am really satisfied
          for this 'mini' project. And it is glad to see there's still room for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>At last also huge praise to Marcus, he implemented the interface with telegram and cloud server. So we did not need to
          design our own interface and host our robot. And effectively, everyone in the class can try out our bots on telegram!

        <h2>Group project 1 - Clever Washer on the campus</h2>

        <p>Created: 26-2-2022</p>
        
        <h3>Where do we started?</h3>
        <p>We have asked the pain point of living in campus to some of our friends and among ourselves. 
          Their feedback was the like the queuing problems in the library and the canteen, as weel as the laundry problems.</p>
        <p>Therefore, We have decided to make an app design with the idea of 'Smart Laudry'. 
          The reason behind this is that, we found ourselves all have the idea to improve the laudry rooms on campus. 
          The thing is, everytime a student goes down to laudry rooms, he found no machines available, and have to either wait or go back to his room with no luck.
          Another thing is, many students they just forgot to take their clothes out even the washing is finished anyway.
          <br>
          <h3>the Persona POV</h3>
          <P>Think of a persona, we got a busy student, he has many deadlines coming, there's not really much time left, how can he even bother with washing clothes?? 
            He suggested should be a better solution to this! He want to know the status of all washer/dryer in his hall in advance,
            so he can go to laundry room without wasting his time checking the availability. 
            Also, he wants the other students to take all their clothes out of their washer immediately, so he can use their machines.</P>
          
          <h3>Our Decision</h3>
          <p>We decide to show the realtime status of the machines, students could queue on the machines that are about to complete.
            It will be presented in a app, student also get their notification for completion of the clothes via mobile app.
          Altogether with other functionalities.</p>
          <h3>In developement, My learning</h3>
          <p>I joined the task on making the apps on a website called 'figma'. We tried to implement some of the UX/UI designs feature here.
            Including a dark theme + round corner design. Let's see what's in our app.
            <img src="images/1.jpg" width="400" height="500">
            <br> you can see the basic design theme of our app, including the washer list, timer, the blue lines are for the control/function flow(more on that later).</p>
            <h3>the Challenge</h3>
            <p>The real challenge, however, comes when arranging that many elements inside figma. 
              So we have 3 peoples working together on this. But we all agreed that when it comes to editing the figma elements, it's very complicated.
              The objects have different depth, layering, makes it very hard to click, edit. Luckily, we group the things in a organise manner, making it 
              a lot easier to change, the downside though, is we need more time to explain it to other members on the organisation.</p>
              <h3>Gettings hands on</h3>
              One thing about Figma which is good though (thanks you to Elizabeth for recommending such tool) is the ability to implement simple flows.
          <br>For example, we have designed many sub menus, tips, and other funcitons inside our app. How to we navigate inside these functions,
          we think by using a menu(or 'Hamberger' if you prefer that name). The menu will have 4 elements, and the user can interact with them.
          <img src="images/2.jpg" width="400" height="500">
          <br>Yeah...The blue lines are very messy, but they are the backbone of our functionalities. 
          The blue link are the flows of our control. It's like, if we press one of the button, it will follow the lines from that button, to the page we *point to.
          <img src="images/3.jpg" width="500" height="400">
          <br> The functionalities are mostly done via linking pages together with this flow function shown in the picture. Also, we had a hard time tuning the rounded corner elements and the relative position of elements.
          <h3>Experiences</h3>
          In my opinion, I think making a balance of intuitive control to the user and the aesthetics of elements&color scheme is a interesting topic.
          You can make the colors contrasting very well, that will make the whole app ery intuitive to the users because they know the elements are different things
          from the fact that they have different colors. But, that will destroy whole balance in color scheme, aesthetics area of the app will be ruined.
          On the other hand, using coherance, paired color is good, but it is not so inituitive to users, or epressing our intended idea by that color&shape.
          So in this case, different shapes are needed to indicate the elements are different. But then we have to think again our shape scheme (Remember the rounded-corner thing I mentioned before?)
          <br> <br>Anyway, It is a fun group project at the end. I know how to balance my own idea in the functionalities of the app, with our teammates, after working with them.
          Adding too much complex functionalities on a simple app (which is our start point) can sometimes be a bad thing (not to mention whether our tech allows it),
          but, too least function also makes it not attractive. Here co-operation is great for such situation, we can discuss and found a balance sweet point with
          each of our own reasonings.
